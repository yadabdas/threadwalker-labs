# Threadwalker Labs

**Exploratory notebooks at the intersection of Physics, Behavioral Modeling, and Artificial Intelligence.**

This repository is a conceptual laboratory for transmuting theoretical frameworks, from mathematics and thermodynamics, into practical models for distributed systems, security, and market dynamics.

## 🔬 Research Lenses

### 1. Thermodynamic Security (AppSec)
Reasoning about system vulnerabilities as **energy gradients** and **phase transitions** rather than binary logic. This lens shifts the focus from "locks and keys" to the geometry of stability surfaces.



### 2. Behavioral & System Modeling
Applying mathematical polynomials and optimization techniques to identify asymmetries in human and system behavior.



### 3. Real Estate AI
Leveraging machine learning to decode market dynamics and value surfaces, treating real estate data as a fluid, evolving landscape.

### 4. Data-Driven Reflections
Technical and philosophical post-mortems on engineering architecture, scaling, and the CAP theorem.
